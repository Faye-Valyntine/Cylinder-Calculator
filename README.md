# Cylinder-Calculator
This was a college project for C++. The idea was to create a solution that utilized a class to calculate dimensions and costs.
The user inputs data for class members (using inches for the height and radius), which are then used to calculate volume, surface area, shipping and painting costs.
The volume and surface areas are also converted from cubic and square inches to liters and square feet, respectively, before calculating costs.
There's also a while loop that allows the user to make as many separate calculations as they wish.
